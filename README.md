Jiahui's homework for Module 3

Hi,

Due to the performance of my PC, visual studio runs so slowly on my machine. Instead, I use Jupyter Notebook for coding. The "PyBank.ipynb" and "PyPoll.ipynb" are the conding files for the Module 3 challenge --- two Python challenges. The "budget_data_result.txt" and "election_data_result.txt" are the results. Please run "PyBank.ipynb" and "PyPoll.ipynb" in Jupyter Notebook.

Before running the two *.ipynb files, please change the "path" for reading my file:

with open(path, 'r') as myFile

The path should be where you save the "budget_data.csv" and "election_data.csv".

The *.ipynb files should be error free based on my test. Again, please change the "path" before running. Thank you!
